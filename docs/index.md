# Welcome to the Slime Rancher Modding Guide

In this place, yes. This place. You will learn how to create your very first mod for Slime Rancher.

## Introduction

Slime Rancher Modding Guide <sup>(SRMG)</sup> is a **modding guide** for helping new, and long-time, modders create mods for **Slime Rancher 1 / 2**.


### Getting Started

To get started, use the top navigator of the site, and choose where you would like to go first!

!!! info "It is best to mention..."

    When it comes to modding Slime Rancher, or Slime Rancher 2, you must use a programming language known as **C#** <sup>(Pronounced C-Sharp)</sup>.
    This guide will **NOT** teach you how to write C#, and it could go the same for understanding. You will have to learn that elsewhere.

    It is **highly recommended** that you at least know the basics beforehand. It may save you a lot of unnecessary trouble.
    This is a [frequently shared C# guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N775KsWQVkw&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4CtEelGPsmPzlvP7ISPYzR) within the community.


!!! warning "Before you continue..."

    This guide will be using code written by **you**, and **you only**. It is the one of the best ways for you to learn, and grow your skill as a newcomer.

    If you are here hoping to use anything third-party, such as: **AI**, **mod templates**, or **(mod simplification) libraries**; this may not be the place for you. 
    There aren't any guides written here for that, and there never will be.

    Any third-party utilities in usage will have specific purposes, and are **entirely optional**. This is not to count what is listed in the [Utilities]() section of the site.

!!! tip "Something you might want to know!"

    **Don't copy paste**! This guide will be written in a way to try and prevent that, but rather help you **develop alongside it**.
    If you're just copy pasting code, you may **never learn anything**, and run into issues you don't know how to fix.
