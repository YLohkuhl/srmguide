We're about to embark on a new journey, but there are a few pre-requirements that you may need to fulfill first.



## Prerequisites

- A **Non-Pirated** copy of **Slime Rancher**

!!! warning "Before you continue..."

    **You will not get support, from me, or anybody else if you're using a pirated copy**. Do keep this in mind!

- **[Slime Rancher Mod Loader ^(SRML)^](https://www.nexusmods.com/slimerancher/mods/2)**

!!! note "A quick note..."

    Slime Rancher Mod Loader does not work on: **Microsoft**, **Consoles**, and **Pirated Copies**. 
    It however works with: **Steam**, **Epic Games**, and **DRM-Free Copies**.

- **[.NET Framework v4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net481-developer-pack-offline-installer)**

- **Integrated Development Environment ^(IDE)^**
    
!!! note "A quick note..."

    **[Rider](https://www.nexusmods.com/slimerancher/mods/2)** is recommended, do be aware that you cannot use it for commercial use (not that you should, or are allowed to). Use **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** in other cases if you still want free options.

<!-- !!! info "It is best to mention..."

    Unfortunately, this guide **only supports Windows**. After this guide is published, I'm hoping to find further help on how to set it up with Linux.
    
    **Modding Slime Rancher does not work on Mac devices**. -->
